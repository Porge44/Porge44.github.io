    WHERE DO YOU GO WHEN YOU FALL ASLEEP? IT IS BLACK AND IT IS COLD AND IT BURSTS WITH COLOUR AT THE EDGES, COLOURS YOU CAN'T QUITE SEE. THERE IS LAUGHTER HERE, SOMEWHERE, SOFT AND TINKLING LIKE A DISTANT BELL, A SOUND LONG SINCE LOST TO YOU. <br /><br />
    HE'S HERE, ISN'T HE?<br /><br />
    MAYBE THEY ALL ARE, FOREVER YOUNG IN THIS PLANE BEYOND CONSCIOUSNESS, JUST TOO FAR FOR YOU TO REACH. THEY ARE LAUGHING, ALL OF THEM, THEY ARE WATCHING YOU WITH POPCORN KERNELS CRACKING LIKE BULLETS BETWEEN THEIR TEETH. AND YOU WILL SEARCH FOR THEM, GROPING BLINDLY THROUGH THE DARK, HERE WHERE YOUR MACHINERY FAILS YOU, AND YOU WILL CRY AND YOU WILL SCREAM AND THEY WILL<br /><br /><br />

    LAUGH
