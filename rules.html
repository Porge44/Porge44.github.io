            <h2><i class="fa fa-medal"></i> <i>COMPLETE THE QUEST</i></h2><p>Each Round will have an objective or quest that the Protagonists need to complete in some way. As the Party gathers more information on the current Round's Quest, the Party's 'Current Round' tab will update accordingly. Rounds may also have sub-quests available to Protagonists that meet certain conditions. Sub-quests are <b>not</b> necessary to complete the Quest, but they will provide extra points and prizes for the Party, so they're always recommended.</p>
            <p>Most Rounds do not have a time limit in which the objective must be completed; however, if a Party or Protagonist appears to be deliberately stalling The Game for any reason, the Host will punish the Protagonists in question, ranging from added obstacles to Protagonist disqualification.</p>

            <h2><i class="fa fa-coins"></i> <i>GATHER POINTS</i></h2><p>While completing the Quest for a Round signifies the end of a Round, it does not necessarily mean you have won that Round. The real deciding factor is the Party's accumulated point score! Points are earned by performing actions relevant to your current Quest - we won't get into the mathematical details of it here, and fortunately you won't need to know either! All scores are tallied live as Protagonists progress, and can be checked simply by asking your Harmony device. <p>The more points a Party earns in a Round, the better their performance - this is reflected at the end of the Round in Stars, ranging from 1 to 3. Earning Stars does not give out prizes; however, the more stars you earn, the more likely you are to beat other Parties. Always aim for a 3 Star Round if you want to live! Points needed for each Star for your current Round can be found in your 'Current Round' tab.</p>

            <h2><i class="ra ra-decapitation"></i> <i>DO NOT ATTACK THE GAMEKEEPERS</i></h2><p>The Gamekeepers take on many forms in The Game, but they all can be identified by the mark of The Game on them. Attacking the Gamekeepers is pointless, and will only result in disqualification of the attacking Protagonists. Instead, please give the Gamekeepers the respect that they deserve and follow any directives they give. </p>

            <h2><i class="ra ra-bleeding-eye"></i> <i>DO NOT TRUST THE INSECTS</i></h2><p>The beetles are not your friends. They want to change you, want to break down everything you ever thought was beautiful and build their hexagons from your bones. The ants whisper beneath your feet about the parts that make you, the worms think you are imperfect as you are. A maggot cannot hear the song of clicks and buzzing and colour that lives in you, all those wonderful collisions of chance that lets you laugh and bleed and cry. Do not follow the dragonfly when he comes, no matter how sweetly he speaks of dronedom. Do not look into the spider's web.</p>
            <p>THE BEETLES ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS.</p>
