		<div class="termtitle"><h1>TERMINOLOGY</h1></div>
		<div class="boxcontainer"><div class="box"><h2>ROUND</h2><i class="fas fa-stopwatch" style="color:#d0021b;font-size: 40px;"></i><p>A section of variable time in which the Protagonists are given a Quest to complete, often with optional sub-quests. The Round will end once the main Quest is complete, after which the Party will be scored and their fate will be determined. If the Party has succeeded, the next Round will then begin within the next 24 hours.</p></div><div class="box"><h2>QUEST</h2><i class="fas fa-scroll" style="color:#d0021b;font-size:40px;"></i><p>The overarching challenge given to the Party to complete during the Round. Most Quests are vague enough to allow multiple different methods of completing it - so don't be afraid to try whatever plan enters your primate-descended brains! You can check your Current Round tab's 'Quest Info' for occasional hints of ways to complete the Quest. </p></div><div class="box"><h2>SUB/SIDE QUESTS</h2><i class="fas fa-sparkles" style="color:#d0021b;font-size:40px;"></i><p>Side-quests are optional challenges presented to a Party during their round, usually completely seperate from the main Quest. A Party does not need to complete any Side-Quests to win the Round, however Side-Quests do offer bonus points and prizes that can assist Protagonists - sometimes even in future Rounds! We highly recommend trying to complete side-quests whenever you can.</p></div><div class="box"><h2>PROTAGONIST</h2><i class="ra ra-player"></i><p>A player participating in The Game. These individuals were chosen by The Host for their entertainment potential. If you are reading this, this refers to you!</p></div><div class="box"><h2>PARTY</h2><i class="ra ra-double-team"></i><p>A team, usually consisting of two or three Protagonists. Every Protagonist in The Game is assigned by The Host to a Party at the beginning of The Game. Party members work together to accumulate points and complete Quests, so maybe think twice before you go killing your Party members.</p></div><div class="box"><h2>GAMEKEEPER</h2><i class="fas fa-user-headset" style="font-size:40px;color:#d0021b;"></i><p>A servant of The Game, tasked with helping The Game run smoothly. They take on many shapes and attributes, but always have the mark of The Game ( a star with an eye in the center ) somewhere on them. They are interwoven in the fabric of The Game; as such they are all-powerful entities with unlimited potential, and cannot be damaged by Protagonists. Attacking a Gamekeeper will result in severe punishment, most commonly death.</p></div></div>
