    ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A MAN ON THE MOON, WHO OFTEN VISITED THE EARTH TO SATE HIS BOREDOM. ONE DAY HE DECIDED TO DESCEND FROM THE MOON AND DISGUISE HIMSELF AS A STARVING BEGGAR, AND ASK THE FIRST THREE LIVING BEINGS HE SAW FOR FOOD. FIRST HE ASKED THE MONKEY, AND THE MONKEY BROUGHT HIM FRUIT. THEN HE ASKED THE FOX, AND THE FOX BROUGHT HIM FISH. THEN HE ASKED THE RABBIT, AND THE RABBIT JUMPED INTO THE CAMPFIRE AND OFFERED HIMSELF AS A MEAL.<br /><br />
    IT MUST HAVE HURT. OF COURSE IT HURT. BUT THE RABBIT COULD NOT TAKE IT BACK. HE DID NOT JUMP FROM THE FIRE, FOR HE WAS TOO KIND, AND WANTED TO FEED THE POOR BEGGAR MORE THAN THE FIRE AGONISED HIM. THE PRINCE OF A THOUSAND ENEMIES BURNS HIMSELF FOR OTHERS, HIS SKIN BUBBLES AND HIS BONES POP LIKE FIRECRACKERS AND THE OTHER ANIMALS HOWL WITH GLEE TO SEE IT, TO ONCE AGAIN TASTE THE STRANGENESS THAT LIES WITHIN HIS BLOOD.<br /><br />
    AND WE WATCH YOU BURN WITH GLEE.
