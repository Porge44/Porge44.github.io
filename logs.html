            <h2><i>#0001</i></h2><p>Isaiah and Tinkerhell began their first Quest together as a party, with their spawning point at Vityan Square. They panicked for a while in an amusing fashion before deciding to follow the wail of police sirens to a gruesome homicide scene. Tinkerhell managed to get the responding officer to divulge some informaion and the Party discovered that a middle-aged human man, Jaiden Barkorsk, had been brutually stabbed to death by his thirteen-year-old son, Milo. The boy appeared srange and distant, and both Protagonists suspect nothing is as it seems. They cannot investigate further, however, as another homicide is reported. Will the Protagonists remain at the bloody apartment complex, or follow the sirens to the next miserable scene?</p>
