                 You have been selected by the delightful Host to participate in the most thrilling game since the birth of existence! The mark on your arm identifies you as a Protagonist. As a Protagonist, you will be facing a wonderful variety of obstacles and challenges over the course of several rounds of The Game in hopes of earning the ultimate prize - your life!</p>
            <p>The basis of The Game is simple. You and a team of up to three others (referred to as your Party) will play in several Rounds, each with a unique Quest for you to complete, and earn points along the way. Your Party competes against other Parties to earn the highest score of all participants in each Round. The lowest scoring Party will be disqualified after each Round until the The Game is over. Easy, right? </p>
            <p>This here is your handy Manual, installed permanently across all of your Harmony devices. You can refer to it for all Game-related subjects! Feel free to tour the tabs below and familiarise yourself with the content. It's sure to come in handy later.</p>
            <p>Enjoy playing!</p>
